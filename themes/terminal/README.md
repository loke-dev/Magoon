## What is this theme for? 🍻

This theme is for Xresource enabled terminals.

<!-- This is where you specify which software you're making pretty! -->

## Where can I get it? 🤲

It's right here in this folder. You'll need the contents from the `terminal.Xresources` file.

<!-- This is where you specify links to ex. vscode marketplace, alfred, etc. -->

## Show me the beauty 💅

<!-- This is where you show screenshot! -->

## Install instructions 🛠️

1. Add the information from `terminal.Xresources` to your `.Xresources`
2. Change every `*.` to your terminal. ( ex. URxvt.color0: #232f39 )
3. Now it should be all magoonified! 💚

If you're not using a terminal that doesn't support `.Xresources`, such as the `GNOME terminal` - you could just copy each color into the correct spot.

Just take each color `*.color0: #232f39` - and put it in palette entry 1, rinse and repeat.
You'll end up with palette settings that look like the following:
